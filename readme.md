# Golang project
Create a full stack using golang & sqlite for backend
and using go templates for frontend

--Notes:
* Program should serve records 
  from sqlite DB to the browser
* Data should be sanitized
* Server should be secure
* Should have caching 
* Maybe rate limiter

## SNIPPETS
   store SNIPPETS of data
- make project directory & git init
- add external packages 

    -  added basic server
    -  added DB methods
    -  next frontend
    -  need to add tests
    -  refactor if needed
- add new features
- When your go knowledge has improved,
  come back and see where improvements
  are needed
